# insta-scraper
## instagram saved posts scraper.

Just a random idea I had when studying for exams

uses bsoup and requests to get post description from instagram.

requires you to download data from instagram and copy /saved to script directory
## Quick start
1. run jsonParsing.py after copying /saved to script directory.
2. run scraper.py to scrape description from instagram post descriptions.
3. run hashtagger.py to extract hashtags from post descriptions.
4. run counter.py to get key-value pairs of hashtag-count
5. (optional) run plotting.py look at it.
   
<hr>

    that's all its doing, just plotting points, I've no idea what do with it open a issue if you have some ideas
</hr>
## Why?
I have no idea, I now have a bunch of text files with hashtags from the post description and their counts

Might actually use the data sometime in the future.

## Optimisations?
None pending for now. Already been testing for 2 days

## Libraries/Modules used
